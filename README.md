# Sarcasmbot

This software is a chat generation module that replies sarcastically to user input. Feel free to use the code, and report bugs at: adityaj@cse.iitb.ac.in, and anoopk@cse.iitb.ac.in.

## Usage
The included code is a java project. The code can be used as follows:

1. Download sentiwordlist.
2. Set up an eclipse (or similar) project. Import code from SarcasmTalker.
3. Download stanford-postagger. Uncompress.
4. Include the pos-tagger jars in the eclipse project.
6. Get the location of tagger modelfile. For example, for me, it was: ~/jars/stanford-postagger-full-2014-01-04/models/english-left3words-distsim.tagger
7. Modelfile in (6) is argument 1. Sentiwordlist path in (2) is argument 2. Call Main.sarcasticChatter with these two arguments.

The sentiwordlist can be downloaded from: http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/opinion-lexicon-English.rar
